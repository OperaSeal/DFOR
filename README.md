## Classwork

This is a repo of my classwork from my [DFOR 772](https://catalog.gmu.edu/search/?P=DFOR%20772), [DFOR 740](https://catalog.gmu.edu/search/?P=DFOR%20740), [DFOR 664](https://catalog.gmu.edu/search/?P=DFOR%20740) and [DFOR 660](https://catalog.gmu.edu/search/?P=DFOR%20660) classes.
Everything was handwritten by me, and inspired by Professors Jim Jones, Bob Osgood, and Michael Robinson.
