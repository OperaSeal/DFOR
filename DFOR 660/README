Documentation for "response"

This script was made by Hiller Hoover for DFOR 660 in the Fall 2024 semester at GMU.

This flash drive is designed to be plugged into an Ubuntu 24 system, to have the response script run as root, and then to send it's output to /data on the flash drive.
Please run the script as root and follow along with the on-screen instructions.
The /data folder will contain a wealth of forensically valuable data, but it should not be analyzed on the target machine.

After use, unmount the flash drive with the umount command, and then analyze the information on another computer (preferably linux).
It is reccommended to use the tar command to zip all of the /data folder off of the collection flash drive.
Afterwards, you should remove or rename the /data folder. This will prepare the flash drive for it's next use.
